This entire article evolves around a hypothetical nation named "Irrationation". The pupils of the nation - also hypothetical individuals - are called "Irrationationals". Irrationation cannot be located in any map you possess - nor any algorithm you create. It is entirely hypothetical, although you might find parallels to certain nations on Earth. No sciences of geography is of our concern regarding Irrationation; we'll only study its cultural, social and political ideologies. Such structures and ideologies run parallel with the contemporary world we live in. However, you'll undoubtably notice differences. The "differences" are primarily due to how you think, how you have been taught to think, and what your ideologies are. It is entirely upto you to reckon where Irrationation lies, in the spectrum of Utopia and Dystopia.

### The History of Irrationation

Irrationation has a colonial past. It was subjected to various conquests from the regions of Europe. Europian conquestors saw several geographical signficances - which we will not discuss here - and landed on Irrationation's shores. Malintent gained hold, and the initial colonials were driven out by the strongforces of Irrationationals. This phenomenon carved "Irrationalism" into the pupils of Irrationation. They were proud Irrationationals, for they had protected their motherland. However, this pride was overwhelming. It went beyond pride, and the humility of ancient Irrationationals was dilluted. Stories were woven, written and grapevined, and they spoke of great structures the ancient Irrationationals built. The literary works which documented the passage of time failed to mention the positives - progressive outcomes - of the nation's colonial past. The period of conquests was the most prominent way which Irrationation got exposed to the rest of the world. The conquestors brought and built methods of transportation - like railways - planted exportable flora, and opened trade routes. Something which was once a closed enclosure was made an open hub. Drowned in the overwhelming pride, the pupils forsake to continue to build on what the colonists brought. Eternally dreaming on their flying machines which were powered by wind (myth), they forgot to grow. What they did not realize, however, that the rest of the world was keeping up in pace.

### Political & Social Facets

Both political and social facets of the nation are heavily linked to one crucial dimention: _religion_. Religion, like many other places, is deeply ingrained into individuals when anxiety takes hold. Heed the following from Lucretius:

> "They make propitiatory sacrifices, slaughter black cattle and despatch offerings to the Departed Sprits.. As Children in blank darkness tremble and start at everyting, so we in broad daylight are opressed at times by fears as baseless as those horrors which children imagine coming upon them in the dark. This dread and darkness of the mind cannot be dispelled by the sunbeams, the shining shafts of day, but only by an understanding of the outward form and inner workings of nature.. How many crimes has religion led people to commit?" (De Rerum Natura, trans. R.E. Latham, London, Penguin, 1951)

Both Epicurus and Lucretius disregarded religion's aid in finding solace from anxiety of "not knowing". Pupils of Irrationation are following a religious doctrine, where they also resort to measures where the inexplicable is handed over to the deities. However, the original doctrine that Irrationationals are trying to pursue, is ancient. Although it was written by philosophers of a different age, it hardly got adapted to the new age. This is also due to the fact that the Irrationationals are too overwhelmed with pride of having "the best religion". The ability to reconcile, rationalize (hence, the name of the nation), and critically analyze is hardly found amongst the countrymen and countrywomen of this nation. This is precisely because of the overwhelming belief of their own well, which they deem to think is the richest well that there ever is.

</p>

What is surprising, however, is that because of the inability to reconcile between facts, the Irrationationals sometimes fail to recognize the true meaning of their religious texts as well. They misinterpret, and because of the dogged belief, they end up in paths of frustration. 

#### Polical Gains

When such mindsets are instilled into people's minds, the shrewd gains are plenty. In a nation where rationality is not the norm, and a large amount of people fail to reconcile facts with figures and tend to believe looking only at the surface, there are numerous political advantages for the cunning individual. Imagine a person - an individual with a higher emotional quotient - entering into politics from a relatively younger age. What does he have to do, in Irrationation, to gain voter confidence? He needs to find the points where the society is the most vulnerable at. In Irrationation, it is the lack for the demand of rationality. The individual's higher EQ would suggest him that for a society which does not take in the facts, could be easily handled and manipulated by emotions. Which kinds of emotions? Emotions that are most sincere to them; religion and nationality. These two facets were cultivated from the history of Irrationation and still keep bubbling up. A cunning individual who waves these two facets as the pillars of his political agenda, can indeed go deep into the populace and win the vote. He does not need to stop there. Dynasties - just like old times - can also be welcome, if they keep flailing the same pillars at the society. 

These two facets are very easy to manipulate. If the voter confidence shrinks, build a religious institution, or arouse nationalism (perhaps by ridiculing or attacking another nationality). When individuals gets how it can be manipulated, dynasties, neopotism and oligarchies form. Such groups would fail to adhere to true democracy, due to several reasons. The most obvious, being that due to the already established political capital of the individuals within the group have a better unequal chances of being elected [1]. The political skill here, however, is inadequate, since the closer the candidate to a political party the higher his chances to be nominated. Hence, political kinship is endowned with higher value of electorial capital and electorial liquidity. Due to this, the incumbent's already established functions such as media are also endowed to the upcoming individual. To summarize, an eligible person from a political family is endowed with [2]:

1. Brand Recognition
2. Voter confidence (trust)
3. Media coverage
4. Pre-existing networks

> When you live under such an oligarchy, there is always some crisis or the other that takes priority over boring stuff such as healthcare and pollution. If the nation is facing external invasion or diabolical subversion, who has the time to worry about overcrowded hospitals and polluted rivers? By manufacturing a never-ending stream of crises, a corrupt oligarchy can prolong its rule indefinitely. (21 Lessons for the 21st Centry, p.12)

Certain crises such as war double politicial fanaticism. If you're such a fanatic, all you've got to do is to order your generals to somehow win the war. Now, winning war in the modern age (and of course, in history throughout) is not a feat that should be taken lightly. The eventualities, however, are tears, sweat and blood of soldiers and fanatically risen politicians. People begin to embrace such politicians with "nationalism", when the soliders who bled for the country go back to their civilian lives, or back to being soldiers without a war. It is quite certain that the highest gain out of winning a war is political, in a society of irrational minds. A populace whose minds are so bent that thinking clearly means a nuisance is a society - just like in Irrationation - which careens through to its downfall. 


#### Societal Development

Progression of societal facets such as education, mental and physical well-being are partly the responsibility of the society. This is not to say that the management of the nation has an wavering responsibility to build such exercises, but it is by no means a sole responsibility of a government. The values and beliefs of a society is deeply ingrained into the products of education. Competition, for example, is valued differently at different regions. It is a basic economic theory that when resources are scarce, the competition for that particular resource grows. However, over-competition kills aspects of well-being. This is a fate most likely for society void of rational thoughts which is largely focused on running on their old, unadapted values. Burn-out flourishes both at workplaces and at schools/universities, due to the lack of focus into the areas which are new to the world. Burnouts are frequently gone wrong and the depressions lead to more severe societal degradations.

For instance, the dot-com boom introduced a whole a lot of technology which our mental selves takes time (and resources) to process. The rest of the world has grasped the idea that it is impossible to live without the newfound technologies, and they have understood the fact that if they are to live with such technologies, some other aspects are required to be introduced in order to cure the negatives that come out of them. As a fine example, mental health, in the western world, came out to be regarded central phenomenon. But countries such as Irrationation fail to implement strategies toward such due to the unwillingness (primarily due to irrationality) to keep up with the world. The country's management overlooks such aspects primarily because the nation's growth or goodwill is not for them the prime motive, but their own well-being is.

## Redemption

For nations like Irrationation, the moment of Redemption awaits, but it must pass severities. It is of no surprise that the only method of redemption must be a collective one. The method is quite simple to put into words: _make the society think rationally_. However, what can be easily put into words is quite often, immensly difficult to implement. An endeavour as such requires a great amount of hard work, talent and sweat. There's a hidden requirement, amongst all of these: a crisis. History is rife with nations born out of ashes; Japan which was literally turned into ashes, rose like a phoenix. The success story of Singapore is also endearing - with hard work and good leadership. What is with crises  that makes nations rise? 

> "The Chinese use two brush strokes to write the word 'crisis.' One brush stroke stands for danger; the other for opportunity. In a crisis, be aware of the danger -- but recognize the opportunity" (JFK)

With every crisis, opportunity follows. The true wonder of crises is that they make people look for alternatives. Crises make people watch out of the box, reflect on the past and think about a different - a better - future. The bubonic plague made way for The Renessainse. The Renessainse brought a transition from the medieval to the modern age. Just look at where the modern age led us; the laws of physics, the engine, and a gateway to the stars. Crises is exactly what awaits for Irrationation to be redeemed. The populace needs to be connected - this endeavour is already, quite easily, established by the world wide web. With the individuals willing to spread the correct information, and give the populace know-how on making informed decisions out of data they receive, a society can be established which will not bow down unquestionably to any political agenda. It will be a synthesis of a society of self-identity, a nation so strong that can withstand any calamity befallen on them collectively.  

In such a nation, there would not be a place for dynasties. It would become the hub linking one part of the world, to another.
